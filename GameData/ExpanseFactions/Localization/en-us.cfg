	// Mars Congressional Republic
		#EXP-MCRN-titl = Mars Congressional Republic
		#EXP-MCRN-desc =  Martian Congressional Republic Pariatur qui nisi aliqua. Consectetur mollit quis excepteur exercitation laborum sit quis.
		#EXP-MCRN-descR = The Martian Congressional Republic (MCR) is the governing body that rules over the four billion inhabitants of Mars and is one of the two human superpowers. Their flag is reminiscent of Mars and its two moons, Phobos and formerly Deimos. The Congressional Republic is often in direct competition with Earth and its governing body, the United Nations. Although Mars has a significantly smaller population than Earth, the ruggedness of the people, as a result of the harsher environment and sparser resources, makes Mars a worthy counterweight to Earth's power. The Martian Congressional Republic Navy, although smaller than its UN counterpart, is considered to be more technologically advanced. The executive branch of the MCR is led by the Prime Minister. Like Earth, they actively oppress the Belt and its people.

	// Outer Planets Alliance
		#EXP-OPA-titl = Outer Planets Alliance
		#EXP-OPA-desc = 'Belters' The Outer Planets Alliance (OPA) is a loosely affiliated network borrowing or associating under a core common ideology. It started its life as a labor union or advocacy group, fighting for the interests of inhabitants of the Belt and was often in direct conflict with the inner planets' Earth-Mars Coalition Navy. Its logo is a split circle and distinct factions have cells based at every station in the Belt including two major sites Tycho Station and Ceres Station. The OPA is described as either a sociopolitical movement, according to people sympathizing with Belters, or a terrorist network, according to the inner planets. Because of its decentralized structure and the range of activities by groups claiming affiliation, both descriptions have more than a little basis in fact. The statement that it's decentralized negates the assertion that it has a headquarters.
		#EXP-OPA-descR = Belter is a term used to refer to persons born in the Asteroid Belt or the Moons of the outer planets. In a pejorative meaning, they are also called Skinnies, because of their altered physiology due to growing up and living in a low gravity environment.

	// United Nations
		#EXP-UN-titl = United Nations 
		#EXP-UN-desc = The United Nations (UN) is a sovereign federation of formerly-independent nation-states that spans across several territories on Earth and Luna
		#EXP-UN-descR = The United Nations (UN) is a sovereign federation of formerly-independent nation-states that spans across several territories on Earth and Luna, within the Sol system and Milky Way galaxy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II as an international organization facilitating cooperation in, among other areas, international law. Throughout the 21st century, Earth's national governments were on a continuous decrease in administrative power. After the damage done to the planet's ecosystem reached extreme levels, the world's nations decided to finally put aside their individual interests and international differences and achieve global unification. The UN Secretariat subsequently became the executive leader of all humanity and remained so until the Martian colony was granted independence from the UN. The Secretariat is the center of the executive branch, consisting of the Secretary-General and his or her immediate subordinates. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) interacts with elements beyond Earth's sphere of control, like Mars, the Belt, and settlements in the outer planets, as well as independent interstellar colonies. The UN is seated on Earth in New York City, but also has a presence on Luna, in the New Hague facilities in Lovell City. Its armed forces consist of the United Nations Navy (UNN) and the United Nations Marine Corps (UNMC).
