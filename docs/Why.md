## Introduction by [`RealGecko`][realgecko]

> Lately my Munar base turned into a mess of eight different vessels connected together with KAS winches.
>
> FPS reduced dramatically, managing became nearly impossible.
>
> I turned my gaze on to USI MKS and it's Logistics feature, but MKS adds too much stuff I don't really need.
>
> So after hacking a little I discovered that all logistics is done by USI Tools mod and MKS is not really required to do the job.
>
> Instead of reinventing the wheel I created a set of patches to bring logistics to stock parts.
>
> But I was completely unhappy with the fact that I cannot transfer Rocket Parts from my RP printing lab to nearby RP freight. So I decided to create my own logistics system with a Blackjack and .... whatever...
